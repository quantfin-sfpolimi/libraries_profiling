# Finding the best Open-Source Python API/library for financial data.
Data is the foundamental brick of any financial study and project so, before getting started with one, each developer should firstly choose the right tool that enables him to find good quality data.

This paper presents a systematic evaluation of various open-source financial APIs, aiming to provide clarity and guidance to developers and researchers seeking to integrate financial data into their Python projects.

Our study assesses each API across multiple metrics, including response time, error handling and data cost. By rigorously analyzing these factors, we offer an objective comparison to aid users in selecting the optimal API for their and our specific requirements.


## Code structure
evalutators.py: This file contains all the functions used in main.py to evalute APIs.

lib_profilying.ipynb: this notebooks contains all the calculations, the code and the results of the study. You can run the notebook to replicate the study with different parameters.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

For each api we evaluted, there is a python script containing some useful methods to make the calls.

Usage to replicate this script:

Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

Run the notebook `lib_profiling.ipynb`.
